/**
 * exp/client-light-async (client): the client's light propagation (LevelRenderer.renderLevel → runLightUpdates, up to a
 * third of the render thread on a relighting scene, and whole batches in single frames) runs on a worker while the
 * rest of the frame renders (on FrameReactor's pool, possibly across frames); it is joined at the reactor's points
 * before the next tick, queued packets or a level change touch the world.
 *
 * <p>Safe to overlap: readers (entity light, section compiles — vanilla's compile workers already read concurrently)
 * use the storage's published copy, which the engine replaces as a whole at the end (copy-on-write data layers);
 * nothing else in the rest of renderLevel writes the engine or the chunks. The engine's section-dirty callbacks
 * (ClientChunkCache.onLightUpdate → LevelRenderer.setSectionDirty) are recorded on the worker and replayed on the
 * render thread in order: handed back through the reactor's completion ring when the job ends, or at a join. Difference from vanilla: those sections are marked dirty at the end of the
 * frame instead of mid-frame, so their rebuild starts one frame later.
